## End to End Machine Learning Project

STUDENT's PERFORMANCE PROJECT

1. Problem Statement
This project understands how the student's performance (test scores) is affected by other variables such as Gender, Ethnicity, Parental level of education, Lunch and Test preparation course.

2) Data Collection
- Dataset Source - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams?datasetId=74977
- The data consists of 8 column and 1000 rows.

3) Methodology
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing and visualizing the data to identify trends, correlations, and patterns related to student's performance.

Feature Importance: Determining which features have the most significant impact on performance of students.

Modeling: Building a predictive model to get math score based on the available features.

4) Results
Our model achieved an accuracy of 89.7% on the test set, indicating its ability to predict student's performance based on the provided features. The most important features influencing satisfaction were found.

5) Conclusion
This project demonstrates the importance of analyzing student's performance considering various factors. By understanding the factors that contribute to higher math score, students can make targeted improvements, potentially leading to increased concentration and positive mindset towards education.
